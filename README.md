## About Me
I currently live in my hometown of Tarrytown, New York and am beginning my career as a software developer. 
I graduated from the University of Chicago in June of 2021 with a major in the History and Philosophy of Science and a minor in Computer Science.

<!--While at the University of Chicago, I accomplished a number of exciting things; I received honors on my bachelor’s thesis, a grant to write a creative non-fiction essay based on historical research, a grant to learn German abroad, and countless opportunities to collaborate with my peers in both humanities research and software projects.

In my studies, I was principally interested in the concept of scientific revolution in the early modern European era, and decided to concentrate on the emergence of institutionalized science from the backdrop of natural philosophy. This culminated in my Bachelor thesis project, in which I researched and analyzed the volatile position of English Alchemy among the emerging institutional sciences during the latter half of the 17th century. Broadly, I have a desire to interrogate and situate the role of mythology in the historical development of the sciences. This is the intellectual through-line connecting my thesis project, my creative work, and my pursuit of computer science. How alchemy’s esoteric aesthetic clashed with the new ideals of emerging scientific communities, the ways that the engineers and architects of 19th century New York mythologized America through great industrial works like the Croton aqueduct, and the cosmos of computer technologies that draw their power from the principle of abstraction all share this element of humans crafting the world around them: Humans crafting nature, defining their historical identity, and creating machines that push the boundaries of what we are capable of.

My personal interests are just as nerdy: I love video games, reading fantasy, and talking about artsy movies with my friends. I truly love learning and am always pursuing a new software project, a new foreign language, or a new hobby—often all at once.
