## My Work
On my github you will find various projects I have done, both in my free time and as part of coursework at the University of Chicago.
Here is a quick guide to my most relevant projects:
* [myTetris](https://github.com/goldsmithb/myTetris): a tetris clone I wrote for fun and learning!
* [the odin project css project](https://github.com/goldsmithb/css-foundations-project): a sample homepage for a company written as part of the odin project curriculum.

Thank you to all the wonderful programmers I have collaborated with, past and future.
