## My Work
* [White Owl Records Company Website and Blog](https://whiteowlrecords.xyz): Official website for White Owl Records, an independent record label based in Brooklyn, NY. This brutalist site includes a page for listening to music released by the label and a blog to read content created by the White Owl team.
  * I worked with the label to create this website from scratch, architecting the website within a CI/CD production environment that allows the content to be managed by content creators, totally independent of IT infrastructure needs. From the client's perspective, they enter the content into the custom-built sanity dashboard and their site is updated within minutes--it just works!
  * I leveraged webhooks, the Sanity.io Content Management System's Content Cloud API, Netlify's web hosting services, GitHub's version control services, and GoDaddy Domain management to create a continuous development, continuous integration pipeline that vastly simplifies site maintenance.
  * I chose the technologies thoughtfully, aiming for 0 infrastructure costs and maximizing site speed and accessibility.
  * I created design mocks and implemented the design aesthetic desired by the clients.
  * View the repository [here](https://github.com/goldsmithb/whiteowlrecords).
* [Todo App deployed on a CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/landa44/todoTeam2): a simple CRUD app in an impressive production environment. The complete app is a Java Spring Boot backend API hooked up to an AWS mySQL database and a Node/React frontend application, containerized by Docker and deployed with AWS. All of it--the CI/CD pipeline, cloud infrastructure, network architecture, as well as the web application itself--were a joint effort with my team from Strategio.
* [I/O Local Demo](https://github.com/goldsmithb/io_local_demo): a frontend demo site built for a startup using React.js
  * [Check out the demo Site](https://goldsmithb.github.io/gh_pages_io_local/)

## About Me
I currently live in New York, New York and work as a junior software developer.
I graduated with honors from the University of Chicago in 2021 with a major in the History and Philosophy of Science and a minor in Computer Science.
I lived in Vienna, Austria for one year working as an English teacher with Fulbright Austria.

<!--While at the University of Chicago, I accomplished a number of exciting things; I received honors on my bachelorâ€™s thesis, a grant to write a creative non-fiction essay based on historical research, a grant to learn German abroad, and countless opportunities to collaborate with my peers in both humanities research and software projects.

In my studies, I was principally interested in the concept of scientific revolution in the early modern European era, and decided to concentrate on the emergence of institutionalized science from the backdrop of natural philosophy. This culminated in my Bachelor thesis project, in which I researched and analyzed the volatile position of English Alchemy among the emerging institutional sciences during the latter half of the 17th century. Broadly, I have a desire to interrogate and situate the role of mythology in the historical development of the sciences. This is the intellectual through-line connecting my thesis project, my creative work, and my pursuit of computer science. How alchemyâ€™s esoteric aesthetic clashed with the new ideals of emerging scientific communities, the ways that the engineers and architects of 19th century New York mythologized America through great industrial works like the Croton aqueduct, and the cosmos of computer technologies that draw their power from the principle of abstraction all share this element of humans crafting the world around them: Humans crafting nature, defining their historical identity, and creating machines that push the boundaries of what we are capable of.

My personal interests are just as nerdy: I love video games, reading fantasy, and talking about artsy movies with my friends. I truly love learning and am always pursuing a new software project, a new foreign language, or a new hobbyâ€”often all at once.
